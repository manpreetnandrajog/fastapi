    <H1> The Gift of the Magi</H1>

    <p>ONE DOLLAR AND EIGHTY-SEVEN CENTS.
        That was all. She had put it aside, one cent and then another and then
        another, in her careful buying of meat and other food. Della counted
        it three times. One dollar and eighty-seven cents. And the next day
        would be Christmas.
        </p>

        In the hall below was a letter-box too small to hold a letter. There
        was an electric bell, but it could not make a sound. Also there was a
        name beside the door: “Mr. James Dillingham Young.”</p>
